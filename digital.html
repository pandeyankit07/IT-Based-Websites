        <h4>Digital Marketing</h4><br><br>
        <p>
            Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online based digital technologies
            such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media and platforms to promote products and
            services.[2][3] Its development during the 1990s and 2000s changed the way brands and businesses use
            technology for marketing. As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and
            everyday life,[4] and as people increasingly use digital devices instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6]
            digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing combinations of search engine optimization
            (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign
            marketing, data-driven marketing, e-commerce marketing, social media marketing, social media optimization,
            e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, e–books, and optical disks and games have become commonplace.
            Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as television, mobile
            phones (SMS and MMS), callback, and on-hold mobile ring tones.[7] The extension to non-Internet channels
            differentiates digital marketing from online advertising.[8]<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of digital marketing is inseparable from technology development. One of the first key events
            happened in 1971, when Ray Tomlinson sent the first email, and his technology set the platform to allow
            people to send and receive files through different machines.[9] However, the more recognizable period as
            being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where the Archie search engine was created as an
            index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of computers was already big enough to store huge
            volumes of customer information. Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing,
            rather than limited list broker.[10] These kinds of databases allowed companies to track customers'
            information more effectively, thus transforming the relationship between buyer and seller. However, the
            manual process was not as efficient.<br><br>

            In the 1990s, the term Digital Marketing was first coined,.[11] With the debut of server/client architecture
            and the popularity of personal computers, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications became a
            significant factor in marketing technology.[12] Fierce competition forced vendors to include more service
            into their software, for example, marketing, sales and service applications. Marketers were also able to own
            huge online customer data by eCRM software after the Internet was born. Companies could update the data of
            customer needs and obtain the priorities of their experience. This led to the first clickable banner ad
            being going live in 1994, which was the "You Will" campaign by AT&T and over the first four months of it
            going live, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad.[13][14]<br><br>

            In the 2000s, with increasing numbers of Internet users and the birth of iPhone, customers began searching
            products and making decisions about their needs online first, instead of consulting a salesperson, which
            created a new problem for the marketing department of a company.[15] In addition, a survey in 2000 in the
            United Kingdom found that most retailers had not registered their own domain address.[16] These problems
            encouraged marketers to find new ways to integrate digital technology into market development.<br><br>

            In 2007, marketing automation was developed as a response to the ever evolving marketing climate. Marketing
            automation is the process by which software is used to automate conventional marketing processes.[17]
            Marketing automation helped companies segment customers, launch multichannel marketing campaigns, and
            provide personalized information for customers.,[17] based on their specific activities. In this way, users
            activity (or lack thereof) triggers a personal message that is customized to the user in their preferred
            platform. However, despite the benefits of marketing automation many companies are struggling to adopt it to
            their everyday uses correctly

        <h4>Online methods used to build brand awareness</h4><br><br>
        <p>
            Digital marketing strategies may include the use of one or more online channels and techniques (omnichannel)
            to increase brand awareness among consumers.<br><br>

            Building brand awareness may involve such methods/tools as:<br>

            1>  Search engine optimization (SEO)
            Search engine optimization techniques may be used to improve the visibility of business websites and
            brand-related content for common industry-related search queries.[45]<br><br>

            2>  The importance of SEO to increase brand awareness is said to correlate with the growing influence of search
            results and search features like featured snippets, knowledge panels, and local SEO on customer
            behavior.[46]<br><br>

            3>  Search engine marketing (SEM)
            SEM, also known as PPC advertising, involves the purchase of ad space in prominent, visible positions atop
            search results pages and websites. Search ads have been shown to have a positive impact on brand
            recognition, awareness and conversions.[47]<br><br>

            4>  33% of searchers who click on paid ads do so because they directly respond to their particular search
            query.[48]<br><br>

            A)  Social media marketing<br>
            70% of marketers list increasing brand awareness as their number one goal for marketing on social media
            platforms. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube are listed as the top platforms currently used by
            social media marketing teams.[49] As of 2021, LinkedIn has been added as one of the most-used social media
            platforms by business leaders for its professional networking capabilities.[50]<br><br>

            B) Content marketing<br>
            56% of marketers believe personalized content – brand-centered blogs, articles, social updates, videos,
            landing pages – improves brand recall and engagement.[51]<br><br>

            C) Developments and strategies<br>
            One of the major changes that occurred in traditional marketing was the "emergence of digital marketing",
            this led to the reinvention of marketing strategies in order to adapt to this major change in traditional
            marketing.<br><br>

            As digital marketing is dependent on technology which is ever-evolving and fast-changing, the same features
            should be expected from digital marketing developments and strategies. This portion is an attempt to qualify
            or segregate the notable highlights existing and being used as of press time.[when?]<br><br>

            Segmentation: More focus has been placed on segmentation within digital marketing, in order to target
            specific markets in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer sectors.<br>
            Influencer marketing: Important nodes are identified within related communities, known as influencers. This
            is becoming an important concept in digital targeting.[52] Influencers allow brands to take advantage of
            social media and the large audiences available on many of these platforms.[52] It is possible to reach
            influencers via paid advertising, such as Facebook Advertising or Google Ads campaigns, or through
            sophisticated sCRM (social customer relationship management) software, such as SAP C4C, Microsoft Dynamics,
            Sage CRM and Salesforce CRM. Many universities now focus, at Masters level, on engagement strategies for
            influencers.<br><br>
            To summarize, Pull digital marketing is characterized by consumers actively seeking marketing content while
            Push digital marketing occurs when marketers send messages without that content being actively sought by the
            recipients.<br>

            Online behavioral advertising is the practice of collecting information about a user's online activity over
            time, "on a particular device and across different, unrelated websites, in order to deliver advertisements
            tailored to that user's interests and preferences."[53][54] Such Advertisements are based on site
            retargeting are customized based on each user behavior and pattern.<br><br>
            ->  Collaborative Environment: A collaborative environment can be set up between the organization, the
            technology service provider, and the digital agencies to optimize effort, resource sharing, reusability and
            communications.[55] Additionally, organizations are inviting their customers to help them better understand
            how to service them. This source of data is called user-generated content. Much of this is acquired via
            company websites where the organization invites people to share ideas that are then evaluated by other users
            of the site. The most popular ideas are evaluated and implemented in some form. Using this method of
            acquiring data and developing new products can foster the organization's relationship with its customer as
            well as spawn ideas that would otherwise be overlooked. UGC is low-cost advertising as it is directly from
            the consumers and can save advertising costs for the organization.<br><br><br>
            Data-driven advertising: Users generate a lot of data in every step they take on the path of customer
            journey and brands can now use that data to activate their known audience with data-driven programmatic
            media buying. Without exposing customers' privacy, users' data can be collected from digital channels (e.g.:
            when the customer visits a website, reads an e-mail, or launches and interact with a brand's mobile app),
            brands can also collect data from real-world customer interactions, such as brick and mortar stores visits
            and from CRM and sales engines datasets. Also known as people-based marketing or addressable media,
            data-driven advertising is empowering brands to find their loyal customers in their audience and deliver in
            real time a much more personal communication, highly relevant to each customers' moment and actions.[56]
            An important consideration today while deciding on a strategy is that the digital tools have democratized
            the promotional landscape.<br><br><br>

            ->   Remarketing: Remarketing plays a major role in digital marketing. This tactic allows marketers to publish
            targeted ads in front of an interest category or a defined audience, generally called searchers in web
            speak, they have either searched for particular products or services or visited a website for some purpose.
            Game advertising: Game ads are advertisements that exist within computer or video games. One of the most
            common examples of in-game advertising is billboards appearing in sports games. In-game ads also might
            appear as brand-name products like guns, cars, or clothing that exist as gaming status symbols.
            Six principles for building online brand content:[57]

            .Do not consider individuals as consumers;<br>
            . Have a editorial position;<br>
            .Define an identity for the brand;<br>
            .Maintain a continuity of contents;<br>
            .Ensure a regular interaction with audience;<br>
            .Have a channel for events.<br>

            The new digital era has enabled brands to selectively target their customers that may potentially be
            interested in their brand or based on previous browsing interests. Businesses can now use social media to
            select the age range, location, gender, and interests of whom they would like their targeted post to be
            seen. Furthermore, based on a customer's recent search history they can be ‘followed’ on the internet so
            they see advertisements from similar brands, products, and services,[58] This allows businesses to target
            the specific customers that they know and feel will most benefit from their product or service, something
            that had limited capabilities up until the digital era.

            Tourism marketing: Advanced tourism, responsible and sustainable tourism, social media and online tourism
            marketing, and geographic information systems. As a broader research field matures and attracts more diverse
            and in-depth academic research[59]
