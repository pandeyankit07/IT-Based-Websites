        <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
        <p>Mobile application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most
            commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app
            store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of
            software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.

            Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance,
            healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time,
            convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information. Today, mobile devices—and the mobile
            applications that unlock their value—are the most popular way for people and businesses to connect to the
            internet. To stay relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile applications
            that their customers, partners and employees demand.

            Yet mobile application development might seem daunting. Once you’ve selected the OS platform or platforms,
            you need to overcome the limitations of mobile devices and usher your app all the way past the potential
            hurdles of distribution. Fortunately, by following a few basic guidelines and best practices, you can
            streamline your application development journey.

        <h4>to build a successful mobile app development our team</h4>
        <p>
            At a minimum, your team should include talented mobile developers to code, product managers to lead the way
            for the team and drive the vision/strategy of the app into reality, and designers to create the app's UI and
            spruce up the UX. Choose the people with the right skills that will position the app for a long time
            success.

            1. Visionary
            Project Manager, Business Consultant or Strategist – the position has many names, almost as many, as the
            responsibilities it involves. Still, the Visionary unites multiple tasks under one term, which also captures
            the position’s main function: leading the entire project to the vision of an ideal mobile app.

            To do that, a person should have deep and diverse knowledge of the business industry targeted by the mobile
            project as well as be well-versed in management, development methodologies, and mobile development. A
            visionary is also responsible for the app’s consistency and makes sure it matches the customer’s
            requirements described in the specification documents.<br><br>

            Basically, a visionary is a person in charge who should:

            .have a solid technical background,<br>
            .have good understanding of the business line,<br>
            .inspire, manage and lead human resources,<br>
            .possess high sense of responsibility,<br>
            .be good at multitasking.<br><br>
            2. Designers
            Design implementation may only sound as a one-step work. In reality, mobile design experts first have to
            work with documentation. After processing the requirements, the team devises the app’s navigation mechanics
            and creates basic wireframes. Then, designers work on the look and feel of the app, replicating identical
            UI/UX for specific platforms or creating a stand-alone one for hybrid apps.<br><br>

            A team of designers should consist of:

            .Strategist<br>
            .Navigation planner<br>
            .Visual designer<br>
            .Content planner<br>
            A design team is flexible in their development process. Often, they prefer to work on delivering the UI/UX
            along with testing it: they step back, let the users try out their current project, get their feedback and
            then discuss and make changes at any stage.<br><br>

            3. Developers
            The job of the Android or iOS development team is to process the finished UI/UX layouts and implement them
            all in a real application. Developers should have experience in working with a platform of choice and its
            languages:

            .Java/Kotlin for Android<br>
            .Objective-C/Swift for iOS<br>
            Cross-platform mobile development will need other skills:

            .HTML/CSS/JavaScript for PhoneGap and Cordova<br>
            .C# for Xamarin<br>
            .JavaScript for React Native<br><br>
            Apart from their technical experience, mobile engineers should also have some character traits that would
            help them succeed in delivering projects. One of them is agility – the drive to quickly develop a solid
            basis for an app and improve it further.

            4. Quality Assurance specialists
            QA experts are the first and the most critical audience of the end product. As they test a mobile app, they
            have the right to decide when the project is ready to be presented to the customer or delivered to the
            market. But before making this decision, they should point out all the options for improvement and prove how
            these improvements are indeed necessary.<br><br>

            5. Sales and Marketing specialists
            All efforts of delivering a product would be almost for nothing if not for the efforts of the sales and
            marketing team. Communicating with customers, working on a product brand and creating advertising materials,
            sales and marketing experts turn the product into profit and consolidate success of a large teamwork.
