        <h4>SEO</h4>
        <p>
            Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to
            a website or a web page from search engines.[1] SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic"
            results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of
            searches, including image search, video search, academic search,[2] news search, and industry-specific
            vertical search engines.

            As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms
            that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into
            search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because
            a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine
            results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.[3]

            SEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more
            effective, such as paid advertising through pay per click (PPC) campaigns, depending on the site operator's
            goals. Search engine marketing (SEM) is the practice of designing, running and optimizing search engine ad
            campaigns. Its difference from SEO is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid
            priority ranking in search results. SEM focuses on prominence more so than relevance; website developers
            should regard SEM with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the
            primary listings of their search.[56] A successful Internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building
            high-quality web pages to engage and persuade internet users, setting up analytics programs to enable site
            owners to measure results, and improving a site's conversion rate.[57] In November 2015, Google released a
            full 160-page version of its Search Quality Rating Guidelines to the public,[58] which revealed a shift in
            their focus towards "usefulness" and mobile local search. In recent years the mobile market has exploded,
            overtaking the use of desktops, as shown in by StatCounter in October 2016 where they analyzed 2.5 million
            websites and found that 51.3% of the pages were loaded by a mobile device.[59] Google has been one of the
            companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their Google
            Search Console, the Mobile-Friendly Test, which allows companies to measure up their website to the search
            engine results and determine how user-friendly their websites are. The closer the key words are together,
            their ranking will improve based on key terms. [48]

            SEO may generate an adequate return on investment. However, search engines are not paid for organic search
            traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of
            guarantee and the uncertainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major
            losses if the search engines stop sending visitors.[60] Search engines can change their algorithms,
            impacting a website's search engine ranking, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to
            Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes â€“ almost 1.5 per day.[61] It is
            considered a wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search
            engine traffic.[62] In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web
            accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO.

        <h4>SMO</h4>
        <p>
            Social media optimization (SMO) is the use of a number of outlets and communities to generate publicity to
            increase the awareness of a product, service brand or event. Types of social media involved include RSS
            feeds, social news, bookmarking sites, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
            video sharing websites, and blogging sites. SMO is similar to search engine optimization (SEO)in that the
            goal is to generate web traffic and increase awareness for a website. SMO's focal point is on gaining
            organic links to social media content. In contrast, SEO's core is about reaching the top of the search
            engine hierarchy.[1] In general, social media optimization refers to optimizing a website and its content to
            encourage more users to use and share links to the website across social media and networking sites.[2]

            SMO is used to strategically create online content ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital
            photos or video clips that encourages and entices people to engage with a website. Users share this content,
            via its weblink, with social media contacts and friends. Common examples of social media engagement are
            "liking and commenting on posts, retweeting, embedding, sharing, and promoting content".[3] Social media
            optimization is also an effective way of implementing online reputation management (ORM), meaning that if
            someone posts bad reviews of a business, an SMO strategy can ensure that the negative feedback is not the
            first link to come up in a list of search engine results.[4]

            In the 2010s, with social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people, news
            organizations have become increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating web traffic.
            Publishers such as The Economist employ large social media teams to optimize their online posts and maximize
            traffic,[5] while other major publishers now use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology to
            generate higher volumes of web traffic
