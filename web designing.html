        <h4>Web Designing</h4><br><br>
        <p>
            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
            The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
            including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine
            optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process,
            although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the
            design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web
            design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are
            expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also
            expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

            In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and HTML
            tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure
            authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design.[5] The HTML markup for tables was
            originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using
            HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time,
            as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention
            was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so
            with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table
            structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.[6] CSS was
            introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be
            semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web
            design.

            In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development
            tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to
            ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and
            JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of
            limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if
            they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash
            made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of
            browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.[6]

            Marketing and communication design
            Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be
            an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience.
            Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B)
            business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website
            such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics
            or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web
            navigation,[10] especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or
            business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.

            User experience design and interactive design
            User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works.
            This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and
            labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the
            interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to
            continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet
            less intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less
            experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This
            drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as
            possible regardless of user skill.[11] Much of the user experience design and interactive design are
            considered in the user interface design.

            Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether
            or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the
            plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the
            know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced
            coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of
            enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity
            may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work
            reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target
            audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.
