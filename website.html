        <h4>Website Development</h4>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet
            (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text
            to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
            configuration, and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
            content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end
            developers deal with the servers.

            Basic web pages can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it is not essential to use all three
            of these in one webpage, they can be used in conjunction with each other to make dynamic webpages. There are
            many open source tools for Web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
            stack and Perl/Plack. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
            easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual
            Studio.

            Web developers now help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only available as
            applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information
            and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud,
            Dropbox and Google Drive. These Web services allow users to interact with applications from many locations,
            instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.

            Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development include e-commerce.
            Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services.
            Online retailers such as Amazon.com have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many
            consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by Web development is the blog. Web
            applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments for individual Web sites. The
            increased usage of open-source content management systems and enterprise content management systems has
            extended Web development's impact at online interaction and communication.

            Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Web sites are no longer simply tools
            for work or for commerce, but serve more broadly for communication and social networking. Web sites such as
            Facebook and Twitter provide users with a platform to communicate and organizations with a more personal and
            interactive way to engage the public.

        <h4>Security considerations.</h4>
        <p>
            Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking through
        forms, filtering output, and encryption. Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be executed by users with
        ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of Web development as a whole. Scripts can be used to exploit Web
        sites by granting unauthorized access to malicious users that try to collect information such as email
        addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers. Some of this is dependent on the server
        environment on which the scripting language, such as ASP, JSP, PHP, Python, Perl or Ruby is running, and
        therefore is not necessarily down to the Web developer themselves to maintain. However, stringent testing of Web
        applications before public release is encouraged to prevent such exploits from occurring. If some contact form
        is provided on a Web site it should include a captcha field in it which prevents computer programs from
        automatically filling forms and also mail spamming.

        Because new security holes are found in Web applications even after testing and launch, security patch updates
        are frequent for widely used applications. It is often the job of Web developers to keep applications up to date
        as security patches are released and new security concerns are discovered.

        Keeping a Web server safe from intrusion is often called Server Port Hardening. Many technologies come into play
        to keep information on the Internet safe when it is transmitted from one location to another. For instance TLS
        certificates (or "SSL certificates") are issued by certificate authorities to help prevent Internet fraud. Many
        developers often employ different forms of encryption when transmitting and storing sensitive information. A
        basic understanding of information technology security concerns is often part of a Web developer's knowledge.
